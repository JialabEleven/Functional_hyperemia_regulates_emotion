Calculation of the average value of cerebral blood flow at plateau under whisker stimulation

Acquired laser speckle data were analyzed in MATLAB (version R2021a; MathWorks) using custom-written scripts. 
The peak and valley intensity threshold were determined visually for each image to ensure finding the right point to reach the peak of the blood flow plateau. 
Within the threshold range, the inflection points where the value rises rapidly to a stable level was selected as the point to reach the blood flow plateau. 
The mean of blood flow from the beginning of the plateau phase to the end of stimulation was calculated.
